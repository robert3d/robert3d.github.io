README
======

This is my first [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) based site, currently hosted on [Github Pages](http://robert3d.github.io/). I hope to use this site to post about some of the things I learn about as I continue to develop my web development and design skills.

You can email question and comments to rober3d@gmail.com
